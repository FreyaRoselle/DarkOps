# DarkOps - Malware Simulation for Educational Purposes  

DarkOps is a **malware simulation** project designed for **educational and research** purposes. It mimics fundamental malware behaviors—such as **displaying pop-up messages, interacting with the file system, and creating processes**—to help cybersecurity professionals and researchers conduct **static malware analysis** in a **controlled and safe environment**.  

## 🔥 **Features**  
✅ **Pop-Up Simulation** - Mimics phishing alerts or fake warnings.  
✅ **File System Interaction** - Creates, modifies, or deletes test files to simulate real malware actions.  
✅ **Process Execution** - Demonstrates how malware spawns child processes.  
✅ **Static Analysis Focus** - Helps researchers study malware behavior without executing real threats.  
✅ **Educational Use Only** - Designed for security training and malware research.
