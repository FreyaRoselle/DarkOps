 DarkOps is a malware simulation specifically designed for educational purposes. The project simulates basic malicious behaviorsâ€”such as displaying pop-up messages to the user and attempting file system interactions and process creation. The primary objective of DarkOps is to serve as a controlled and safe environment for static analysis of malware code, allowing researchers to dissect and analyze it without execution.
